# <u>A Simple Salary Prediction App</u>
This app simply takes in data which is manually created by myself containing columns like Experience,Test score and Interview score . We do various manipulations on this small dataset and based on that , we do prediction on this dataset(which loudly spells as a regression problem!!!) given that we tried various regression models and we selected a simple LinearRegression model for simplicity and we calculate the salary for the inputs made via form values on the home page displayed. 

Also I give credit of my work whose tutorials have been highly helpful for starting with this small project : <b>@Krish Naik</b> sir whose YouTube videos were hugely helpful and I'm really looking forward to make more of good projects by myself :D
